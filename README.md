# Pneumonia-Detection-using-Chest-X-ray
In this we are going to talk about project based on Machine Learning which include Cnn and deeplearning.
So, lets get started. 
Follow steps given below to create this project:

I recommend you to download chest x-ray dataset using link provide below.
Dataset Download Link:

step-1: I recomend to code this project on jupyter. so, first we have to configure jupyter notebook.
        follow the provided link to get idea how we are going to use jupyter notebook.
        Link:

step-2: now to create this project without any error i recommend you to check that you successfully provide
        path of jupyter notebook to your system.

step-3: now use provided code to create this project. 
        use code provided in code-1 folder of this repository

 step-4: now i recommend you to make three cell to seprate your code in three sections.

 step-5: I hope you have been successfully get your project executed. now follow sixth step to create frontend
         or interface to uplaod chest x-ray and get prediction.

step-6: Now, this frontend responsive page is made on Sublime Text.

step-7: use code provided in code-2 folder and gif is also been provided. To resolve any error produce during this
        project i recommend you to strictly mind path of your dataset you are providing to your project.
